# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To view the deployed website:
Open [https://password-generator-6d930.web.app] to view it in the browser.

## To run the Website in Localhost:
1. Then Open up your chosen terminal. I tend to use cmd.
2. cd into the directory of \passwordgen.
3. run `yarn add react-scripts` You should then see a folder call node_modules in \passwordgen.
4. run `yarn start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

if `yarn add react-scripts` doesn't work:
Unzip the node_modules.zip in the that can be found in \passwordgen.





## Available Scripts

### `yarn add react-scripts`
Install the package needed for the project

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn run build `

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
